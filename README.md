# wallet-api-gateway

This repository contains code for the api gateway service for the wallet service I will be building to practise spring cloud concepts.
The gateway shall be used to provide routing capabilities to the different services that my microservice application shall be consuming
and will include the common logic and authentication required. Apart from that, the service also provides the following

- ssl termination
- load balancing
- authentication.
- Rate Limiting
